    <p class="lead">
        Welcome to MovieVote! MovieVote is a community-powered app where users can vote for their favorite movies. More functionality will be added later.
    </p>

    <p>
        Admins can search for and import new movies using the TMDB API, while users can vote and engage with the gallery.
    </p>

    <p>Special thanks to TMDB for allowing me to use their API for free. Be sure to check out their site in the link below by clicking their logo.</p><br><br>
